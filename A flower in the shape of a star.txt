The wind from the east arrives
A flower had been crowned
The month was in the middle of the year
And there was a cute little sound
At first sight she saw the light
While wind was announcing her arrival
The soul which blessed this flower
Was poured with perseverance and survival
She became a spirit of a seahorse
While the stallion guided her in the moonlight
The eyes which sought the truth
Became lighthouse for the little one with all her might
This flower had a thirst for knowledge
She became a shield to keep her believes worthwhile
Earth revolved around the sun a few times
Her believes paved the way for the boat along the Nile
The love which made me a better person
The happiness that I crave now
The emotions which have been kept inside
The heart that carries the flow
It's all part of the tapestry HE designed
Threads are altogether to form an art
The flower which still blooms today for us
Is my sister with the purest of heart.
